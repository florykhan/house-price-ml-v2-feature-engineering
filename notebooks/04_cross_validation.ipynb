    "# 04 — Cross-Validation (Model Stability Analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Objective:** To evaluate the stability and generalization behavior of multiple regression models (including OLS, Ridge, and Lasso) using k-fold cross-validation on the engineered feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes:\n",
    "1. [**Dataset loading and feature engineering**](#dataset-loading-and-feature-engineering) — importing the raw housing data and applying the same transformation pipeline used in previous notebooks.  \n",
    "2. [**K-Fold configuration**](#k-fold-configuration) — defining a reproducible 5-fold cross-validation splitter.  \n",
    "3. [**Linear Regression cross-validation**](#linear-regression-cross-validation) — evaluating a scaled OLS pipeline using CV and analyzing fold-level R² scores.  \n",
    "4. [**Performance visualization**](#performance-visualization) — plotting the distribution of OLS CV scores to inspect variance and stability.  \n",
    "5. [**Regularized model evaluation**](#regularized-model-evaluation) — training Ridge and Lasso regression pipelines (with scaling) and computing their corresponding CV R² scores.  \n",
    "6. [**Model comparison**](#model-comparison) — assembling OLS, Ridge, and Lasso results into a unified DataFrame and visualizing their performance.  \n",
    "7. [**Metric export**](#metric-export) — saving both fold-level results and summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) for reporting and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Section links (e.g., “Dataset loading and feature engineering”) work in Jupyter or nbviewer, but may not render in static GitHub previews.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Run `python3 -m src.train` before this notebook if the model has not been trained yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis highlights variance across folds, identifies unstable partitions, and clarifies which regularization approach yields the most consistent performance."

    ">#### 📝 Why This Notebook Uses Cross-Validation Separately\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This notebook evaluates model stability using K-Fold cross-validation, while the project also includes a separate hyperparameter tuning helper (grid_search() in `hyperparameter_tuning.py`).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In a full production pipeline, these two steps are usually combined (e.g., via GridSearchCV), so hyperparameters are selected inside the CV loop — this is called nested cross-validation, and it prevents data leakage.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this project, they are kept separate intentionally:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - the tuning module is lightweight and meant for experimentation,\n",
    "> - this notebook focuses only on evaluating model variability across folds,\n",
    "> - keeping the steps modular makes the workflow easier to follow.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Best practice is to integrate both, but for clarity, they are handled independently here."

    "Lasso uses **L1 regularization**, which can shrink coefficients all the way to zero. This makes Lasso useful for **implicit feature selection**, but it can also become unstable when many features are correlated — as in this dataset (e.g., rooms, bedrooms, households, population).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even with an increased `max_iter`, convergence may be harder, and the resulting R² scores tend to be lower and more variable compared to OLS and Ridge. This reflects L1’s sensitivity to multicollinearity and its more aggressive shrinkage behaviour."

    "\n",
    "Cross-validation reveals clear patterns in model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression** provides the most stable results across folds, with low variance and consistently strong R² scores.\n",
    "- **OLS (Linear Regression)** performs well overall but shows higher variability, including one weak fold.\n",
    "- **Lasso Regression** behaves similarly to OLS but is slightly more sensitive to regularization, especially with the chosen `alpha`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Ridge offers the best balance of **stability and predictive performance**, while the other models remain competitive but less consistent across folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Step:** Proceed to `05_pipeline_demo.ipynb` to integrate all components into a full end-to-end workflow, including feature engineering, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and model saving/loading for deployment or reuse."
