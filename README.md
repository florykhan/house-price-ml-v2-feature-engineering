# 🏠 House Price Prediction — v2 Enhanced ML Pipeline

This repository implements an **advanced, modular machine learning pipeline** for predicting median house prices in California.  
It represents the **second version (v2)** of the project, introducing engineered features, regularized linear models, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and a custom Gradient Descent implementation built from scratch.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this version is to:
- Build a **fully modular, extensible machine learning pipeline** for structured tabular data.
- Introduce **feature engineering and standardization** to improve model stability and performance.
- Implement and compare **multiple linear models**, including OLS, Ridge, Lasso, and a custom Gradient Descent Regressor built from scratch.
- Evaluate model robustness through **5-fold cross-validation** and targeted hyperparameter tuning.
- Establish a **reproducible training workflow** that cleanly separates preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

This version focuses on **engineering best practices**, enabling experimentation, modularity, and reliable performance benchmarking across models.

## 🔄 What’s New in v2 (Compared to v1)

A quick overview of improvements introduced in Version 2:

| Aspect | v1 Baseline | v2 Enhanced Pipeline |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Feature Engineering | Minimal | Full transformations + scaling |
| Models | OLS only | GD (custom), OLS, Ridge, Lasso |
| Cross-Validation | No | Yes — 5-fold |
| Pipeline | Notebook-only | Modular Python pipeline (`src/`) |
| Performance | Higher RMSE | Lower RMSE after FE + regularization |

> 🗒️ **Note:**  
> Version 2 uses a **fully modular architecture** inside `src/`, and the `notebooks/` directory follows a clean, sequential workflow from exploration → baselines → cross-validation → final pipeline.
> `data/processed/` — holds intermediate transformed data during notebook work, but **processed outputs are not persisted** since transformations are reproducible through the pipeline.

## 🧰 Run Locally

You can run this project on your machine using **Python 3.11** and `venv`.

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:florykhan/house-price-ml-v2.git
cd house-price-ml-v2
```

### 2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```
### 3️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Add the dataset
Place `housing.csv` inside the `data/raw/` folder:
```bash
house-price-ml-v2/data/raw/housing.csv
```
> ⚠️ **Note:**  Processed data is not saved in this project. All transformations are applied dynamically through the pipeline.

### 5️⃣ Run the training pipeline (required before running notebooks)
This step is essential — the training pipeline performs all preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training needed for the notebooks to run correctly.

```bash
python3 -m src.train
```

### 6️⃣ Run the notebooks
Launch Jupyter and open the notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Recommended order:
- `01_exploration.ipynb` — data exploration
- `02_model_evaluation.ipynb` — custom Gradient Descent
- `03_sklearn_baseline.ipynb` — sklearn LinearRegression
- `04_cross_validation.ipynb` — OLS/Ridge/Lasso CV comparison
- `05_pipeline_demo.ipynb` — full end-to-end pipeline demo
