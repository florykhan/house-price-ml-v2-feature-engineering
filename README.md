# 🏠 House Price Prediction — v2 Enhanced ML Pipeline

This repository implements an **advanced, custom modular machine learning pipeline** for predicting median house prices in California. It represents the **second version (v2)** of the project, introducing engineered features, regularized linear models, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and a custom Gradient Descent implementation built from scratch — all organized into reusable **source modules** powering the end-to-end training pipeline.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this version is to:
- Build a **fully modular, extensible machine learning pipeline** for structured tabular data.
- Introduce **feature engineering and standardization** to improve model stability and performance.
- Implement and compare **multiple linear models**, including OLS, Ridge, Lasso, and a custom Gradient Descent Regressor built from scratch.
- Evaluate model robustness through **5-fold cross-validation** and targeted hyperparameter tuning.
- Establish a **reproducible training workflow** that cleanly separates preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

This version focuses on **engineering best practices**, enabling experimentation, modularity, and reliable performance benchmarking across models.

> 🗒️ **Note:**  
> Version 2 uses a **fully modular architecture** inside `src/`, and the `notebooks/` directory follows a clean, sequential workflow from exploration → baselines → cross-validation → final pipeline.
> - The `data/` directory is **not tracked by Git** to avoid storing large files and to keep the repository lightweight. Only *raw* data should be placed here. The `data/processed/` folder exists as a placeholder for a scalable workflow, but **no processed data is saved in this project** — all transformations are generated dynamically by the pipeline / notebooks.  
> - The `models/` directory is also **excluded from Git**, since model artifacts are generated during training and can be reproduced at any time by running the pipeline.

## 🧰 Run Locally

You can run this project on your machine using **Python 3.11** and `venv`.

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
**HTTPS (recommended for most users):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/florykhan/house-price-ml-v2.git
cd house-price-ml-v2
```
**SSH (for users who have SSH keys configured):**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:florykhan/house-price-ml-v2.git
cd house-price-ml-v2
```

### 2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

### 4️⃣ Add the dataset
Place `housing.csv` inside the `data/raw/` folder:
```bash
house-price-ml-v2/data/raw/housing.csv
```
> 📥 **Download the dataset:**  
> - Via scikit-learn:  
>   ```python
>   from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
>   data = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)
>   ```
> - Or download the CSV from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
>
> ⚠️ **Note:**  Processed data is not saved in this project. All transformations are applied dynamically through the pipeline.

### 5️⃣ Run the training pipeline
This step is essential — the training pipeline performs all preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training needed for the notebooks to run correctly.

```bash
python3 -m src.train
```

### 6️⃣ Run the notebooks
Launch Jupyter and open the notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 🚀 Future Directions (Beyond This Project)

Although Version 2 concludes the development of this repository, there are several **advanced directions** worth exploring in future machine learning projects:

- **Combine hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation:** use integrated approaches like `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to avoid data leakage and optimize models more systematically.

- **Explore nonlinear models:** tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost), and kernel methods can capture complex relationships missed by linear models.

- **Build more modular and reusable ML tooling:** expand this project’s structure into a general-purpose ML pipeline framework usable across multiple datasets.

- **Add experiment tracking:** use MLflow or Weights & Biases to log metrics, save artifacts, compare runs, and manage the training lifecycle.

- **Improve production readiness:** add model APIs (FastAPI/Flask), Docker containers, simple CI/CD workflows, or model versioning for deployment-focused practice.

- **Work with more complex datasets:** move into NLP, image processing, or time-series problems to broaden your portfolio and ML expertise.

- **Add CI/CD workflows:** introduce lightweight GitHub Actions to automate code quality checks, formatting, dependency validation, and simple import tests, improving project reliability and demonstrating real-world ML engineering practices.
